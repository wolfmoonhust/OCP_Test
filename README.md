# OCP_Test

Objects and classes
    variable and initializer are always executed in the same order they are declared but before any statements in a constructor
    static class for inner class
    final -> could not extend, override (for class, method, variable) https://viettuts.vn/java/tu-khoa-final-trong-java
    static final variable: could assign value in static initialize block
    blank final instance variable must has a value at the end of every contructor
    could reference to static variable/method eventhough instance of class is null
    this: could not access intance using this in static method, static initializer
        sould be placed in the first line of constructor
Method
    java always passes parameters by value NOT by reference, but it can be very confusing because the value can be a reference
    {MethodModifier} MethodHeader MethodBody
    MethodModifier
        access modifier: public, protected, private
        non access modifier: abstract, static, final, strictfp //https://vietjack.com/java/tu_khoa_strictfp_trong_java.jsp
        synchronized, native
    Modifier rules:
        can only appear once as a modifier for a method declaration
        only once of access modifier is allowed for a single method
    MethodHeader
        result of a method declaration(return type), name of method, formal parameters
    MethodBody
    String and primitive data types will not have their changed when the method return to the calling scope
    if you are passing an object reference of any kind, a change will be reflected when the method return
    Constructor
    Overloaded methods
        difference return type or formal paramenter type

    static keyword: could access even though instance of class does not initialize
